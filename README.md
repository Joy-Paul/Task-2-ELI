# Task-2-ELI

Task: Analyze a phishing email to identify potential indicators of malicious intent.
Objective: Recognize and document phishing characteristics based on industry best practices.

üìß 1. Email Sample Overview
Subject Line: "URGENT: Your Account Has Been Suspended!"
Sender Address: support@paypalsecure.com
Email Body Preview:

Dear Customer,
We noticed unusual activity on your PayPal account. For your security, your account has been temporarily suspended.
Please login now to restore access: Click Here
Failure to respond within 24 hours will result in permanent suspension.

üïµÔ∏è 2. Phishing Indicators Found
‚úÖ 1. Suspicious Sender Address (Spoofing)
Claimed to be from PayPal, but the domain @paypalsecure.com is not an official PayPal domain.

Legitimate emails from PayPal would come from @paypal.com.

‚úÖ 2. Email Header Analysis
Return-Path does not match sender domain.

Reply-To address redirects to a completely unrelated domain.

SPF/DKIM validation failed (checked using MXToolbox or similar header analyzer).

‚úÖ 3. Suspicious Link
Hyperlink text shows "Click Here", but when hovered, it points to:
http://paypal-verification123.com/login

The domain is unrelated to PayPal and is clearly fraudulent.

‚úÖ 4. Urgency and Threatening Language
"URGENT", "Account Suspended", "Failure to respond within 24 hours..." are pressure tactics.

Creates fear to push users to act impulsively.

‚úÖ 5. Spelling/Grammar Errors
Sentence structure is awkward:
"Please login now to restore access" ‚Üí "log in" should be two words.
Minor grammatical inconsistencies throughout the email.

‚úÖ 6. Unusual Attachment or Link
Contains a clickable link instead of directing users to manually visit the official website.

Potential malware or credential harvesting site.
